# Data

The data that is used is Trust and Quality of Local Governance in European cities, [source](http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/jrc-coin-regio-trust-and-quality-of-local-governance-in-european-cities-2011-2014). The dataset contains 70 cities in 28 eu-countries. The data is collected by multiple surveys. The publisher of the data is European Union and it was published in 2015. The data was collected 2011-2014. The original dataset contains 53 questionnaire variables, two background variable (country, is city capital) and one variable for id (city). The questionnaire variables are all numeric and have values between 0 and 1.

Because dataset has some problems (especially missing values), too much variables and I would like have more background variables, there is done some data wrangling. The wrangling is done in seperate script that can be found [here](https://github.com/tvkangas/IODS-final/blob/master/wrangling.R).
